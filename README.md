# PowerBI_Company
Hey there! I have made a basic Power BI project using the Kaggle Company Finance Dataset.
I have prepared 3 dashboards i.e.:-
- Product DashBoard
- Profit and Sales Dashboard
- Segment DashBoard

Each Dash Board has at least 3 graphs where I have shown:-
- Trends
- Comparison
- No.of Profit or Unit sold
